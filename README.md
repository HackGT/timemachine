# Hexlabs/HackGT Archive
A collection of all past HackGT (and other Hexlabs?) events!

## Note
This branch is a slightly modified design which i feel like has more expression
but i genuinely have no idea what to do about the background situation, its way too bright
and i dont know what to put behind the cards. flat color looks bad, blur looks bad, maybe
we just section off half the screen to be completely solid color while the left has bg?

### Development
Use `npm i` and `npm run dev` to run locally.
